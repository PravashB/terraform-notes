In the Real World Infrastructure provisioning process, it's rarely going to happen that there will not be any dependencies between two resources.

There are bound to be multiple resources that are going to be dependent on each other.

So, We'll make the Output of one resource as the Input of another one.

How to Link two resources together?

GOAL: We want the content of one file to have the password generated by another resource.

Let's create 2 resources in the 'main.tf' configuration file.

The resource random (https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/random/latest/docs/resources/password) generates a 'result' which as per the document from Hashicorp, is a Read-only sensitive string.

Now, In order to show the value in the local_file resource, we're going to call the output of the random_password resource into a text file generated by the local_file resource 'Pravash'

The interpolation sequence (${...}) converts the evaluated expression into a string and dynamically inserts the password into the file content.
